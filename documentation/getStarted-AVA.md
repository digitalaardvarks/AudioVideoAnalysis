# Get started with AudioVideoAnalysis!

## Record  

AudioVideoAnalysis is designed for realtime spectral analysis of video and audio. by clicking **record**, you record said information onto the applications Display Window.

## Device parameters

Before recording, make sure you have selected your desired device parameters.

## Audio parameters

AudioVideoAnalysis features three distinct section of audio parameters which effect the spectrogram printed in the Display window. These are *audio channels*, *color* and *processing*.

Additionally, the applications features clickpoint data retrieval of any audio information. This means you can click at any point in the display window and get the Amplitude of a certian Frequency(Hz) at a given Time(sec).

**Note**: You can also manipulate the spectrograms *color* and *logarithmic frequency distribution* post-recording!

## Video parameters

AudioVideoAnalysis also features three distinct section of video parameters which effect the motion/videogram printed in the Display window. These are *image selector*, *color* and *filter*. The video section also feature a preview window (or Source display), which lets you see how the video-feed is processed **before** being its printed in a "time domain".

**Note**: you can also manipulate the motion/videogram *color* post-recording.

## Display parameters

The application also features several unique display parameters that enables you to view and plot your spectral recordings in various ways. 

In the applications UI, the **Display** sections features a *RefreshWindow* button (that clears all content from the display window), as well as a *rate* and *grid size* function.

The **Rate** feature lets you control how long it takes the spectral recordings to reach the end of the display window, or from x-min to x-max, effectivly controlling the printing rate of the recording. Thus, a *higher* rate value will result in a *shorter* display length. This `Total Display Time` is dynamically expressed in seconds in the Display section of the UI.

There are more important display parameters in the **Menubar**.

*Bring Display to Front* will enable your display window to always be in front of the app UI. Underneath this option you find 4 different **Viewing options**. These options toggle different ways to view your spectral recording in the display window.

Lastly, you can add **Analysis markers** to our display window by toggeling the *View Display Markers* and *View Display Grid* options. Futhermore, by configuring the *Grid Size* knob in the application UI, you can change the size of your analysis grid.

**Note**: You can resize the display window by simply clicking and dragging. Furthermore, you can change viewing options and add/remove analysis markers post-recording.

## Export your recordings

An important feature to the 2.0 version of AudioVideoAnalysis is the ability to export the images we create. It is importent to note here that **all the features that can be configured post-recording are in place such that we can find good representations of our recordings to export.**

When you want to export an image, a file browser will appear that enables you to choose the export destination.

## Report a problem
