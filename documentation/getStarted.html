      <h1 id="title">Get Started with AudioVideoAnalysis!</h1>

      <h2 class="section-title">Record</h2>
      <p>
        AudioVideoAnalysis is designed for realtime spectral analysis of 
        video and audio. by clicking <strong>record</strong>, said images 
        are printed onto the applications <strong>display window</strong>. 
        Alternatively, hit the <code>spacebar</code> to toggle recording on
        and off.
      </p>

          data-alt="img/1-record.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <h2 class="section-title">Device parameters</h2>
      <p>
        Before recording, make sure to cofigure your
        device parameters. These include <code>camera device</code>, 
        <code>camera format</code> (resolution) and <code>general audio settings
        </code> such as audio device, samplerate, buffersize, etc. 
        The video <code>RefreshDevice</code> updates the video device list. 
        This is handy if you connect new video hardware while running
        the application.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Audio parameters</h2>
      <p>
        There are three distinct sections of audio parameters that each affect 
        the display window spectrogram in varying ways. These 
        are `color`, `audio channels` and `processing`.. These are <code>color</code>, 
        <code>audio channels</code> and <code>processing</code>. 
      </p>

      <img src="img/3-audio-parameters.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        The <strong>audio channel</strong> tabs decide which audio input channels
        to use for your analysis. This can be handy if you have multiple active 
        channels but you only want to analyze the spectral content of specific channels.
        In these cases, the <strong>monitor</strong> tab is quite useful. It enables
        you to monitor the incoming audio signal pre-recording. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>logarithmic</strong> dial controls how logarithmic 
        we want our spectrogram frequency distribution to be. A <em>higher</em> 
        logarithmic value will create a steeper logarithmic curve along the 
        Y-axis of the spectrogram.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img

          data-alt="img/4-logfreq.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        the <strong>spectral blur</strong> is essentially a short vector-sized spectral 
        delay that can be used to create more generalized images of the audio 
        amplitude and frequency content. The spectral blur has 3 modes: <code>no 
        blur</code> - <code>blur</code> - <code>lots of blur</code>.
      </p>

      <img src="img/5-spectral-blur.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        AudioVideoAnalysis also features <strong>clickpoint data retrieval
        </strong> of any recorded audio material. This means you can simply 
        point and click anywhere in the display window and get the Amplitude of a 
        certain Frequency(Hz) at a given Time(sec).
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/6-clickpoint.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/6-clickpoint.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: You can use the clickpoint feature, as well as 
        manipulate the spectrograms color and logarithmic frequency distribution, 
        post-recording.
      </p>


      <h2 class="section-title">Video parameters</h2>
      <p>
        To process the video-feed, you also have three distinct video parameter sections; 
        <code>color</code>, <code>image selector</code> and <code>filter</code>. 
        Additionally, a preview window lets you see how the video-feed is 
        processed <strong>before</strong> it&#39;s printed on the main display 
        window.
      </p>

      <img src="img/7-video-parameters.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        You can view either a motiongram or a videogram in the display window by toggling
        the <strong>image selector</strong>. Both images express vertical motion over time, the only 
        difference is that a motiongram has some additional pre-processing which further 
        isolates motion and reduces image noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        When recording a motiongram, you can use a <strong>binary</strong> or
        &quot;<strong>regular</strong>&quot;(unary) noise reduction filter to 
        reduce unwanted noise in your video-feed. The differences between these two 
        filters are subtle, but a general tendency is that the <strong>binary</strong> filter
        is usually more &quot;radical&quot; than its <strong>regular</strong> counterpart. 
        The preview window can help us see these effects more clearly.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/8-mg-filters.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/8-mg-filters.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: you can also manipulate the motion/videogram color post-recording.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Display parameters</h2>

      <p>
        Several display parameters enable you to pre-configure and view your 
        spectral recordings in various ways. This section features a <code>RefreshWindow</code> 
        button that clears all content from the display window, as well as a
        <code>rate</code> and <code>grid size</code> function.
      </p>

      <img src="img/9-display-parameters.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        <strong>Rate</strong> controls how long it takes the spectral recordings to 
        reach the end of the display window, or from x-min to x-max, effectively 
        controlling the printing rate of the recording. Thus, a <em>higher</em> 
        rate value will result in a <em>shorter</em> display length. This <code>Total 
        Display Time</code> is dynamically expressed in seconds in the Display section 
        of the UI. However, a faster printing rate will result in lower resolution images.
      </p>

      <img src="img/10-rate.jpg" width="787" height="615"/>

      <p>
        There are also more display options in the <strong>menubar</strong>.
      </p>

      <img src="img/11-menubar-display-options.jpg" width="398" height="267"/>

      <p>
        The <code>Bring Display to Front</code> option will glue your display window to the
        front of the screen. Underneath, you will find 4 different 
        <strong>viewing options</strong>. These toggle different ways to view your 
        spectral recording in the display window. 
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/12-view-options.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/12-view-options.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Lastly, you can add <strong>analysis markers</strong> by toggling the 
        <code>View Display Markers</code> and <code>View Display Grid</code> options. 
        Furthermore, by configuring the <code>grid Size</code> in the app UI, 
        you can change the size of your analysis grid. Beware that a grid size of 6 
        corresponds to a visible 4x4 grid. This is because it requires 6 vertical and 
        horizontal lines to generate a 4x4 grid.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/13-analysis-markers.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/13-analysis-markers.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: You can resize the display window by simply clicking and 
        dragging. Furthermore, you can change viewing options and add/remove analysis markers
        post-recording.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Export options</h2>
      <p>
        An important feature of AudioVideoAnalysis is the ability to export
        the images we create. In these cases, the applications post-recording processing abilities
        comes in handy!
      </p>
