      <h2 class="section-title">Open a video file</h2>
      <p>
        The simplest way to open a video file is to drag and drop it anywhere on
        the interface.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/01_open_file_dragdrop.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/01_open_file_dragdrop.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        You can also open a video file by clicking on the <b>File</b> button on the
        <b>Add Video</b> panel.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/01_open_file_UI.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/01_open_file_UI.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Alternatively you can open a video file by selecting <i>File > Open file...</i>
        from the menu.
      </p>

      <img src="img/01_open_file_menu.png"/>

      <h2 class="section-title">Open a folder of video files</h2>

      <p>
        You can also work with an entire folder of video files. Again, the
        easiest way open a folder is to drag and drop it on the interface. After
        the folder has been loaded, you can see its contents as items in a
        dropdown list.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/02_open_folder_dragdrop.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/02_open_folder_dragdrop.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        You can also load a folder by clicking on the <b>Folder</b> button on the
        <b>Add Video</b> panel.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/02_open_folder_UI.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/02_open_folder_UI.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Alternatively you can open a folder by selecting <i>File > Open folder...</i>
        from the menu.
      </p>

      <img src="img/02_open_folder_menu.png"/>

      <h2 class="section-title">Source Display</h2>

      <img src="img/SourceDisplay.png"/>

      <p>
        Within the <b>Source Display</b> you can find a little preview of the loaded video. 
        You can toggle playback either by clicking on the Play icon, or by pressing the Space bar.
        Below the Play icon you can find two yellow arrows, which you can use to nudge the playback
        one frame forward or back. You can also do this by pressing <code>Shift + Left</code> arrow or <code>Shift + Right</code> 
        arrow on your keyboard. Next to the Play icon you can see the <b>Timeline</b>. This can be used
        to quickly skim through the video, and more importantly to select the trimming points of the 
        analysis (see below). 
      </p>


      <h2 class="section-title">Colors</h2>

      <img src="img/Color.png"/>

      <p>
        To change the color space of your source video you have two options in VideoAnalysis.
        To invert colors, go to <i>Color</i> in the menu and check <i>Invert colors</i>. You can 
        also convert the video to greyscale by checking <i>Color > Greyscale</i>. Note that these
        two options are independent from each other, so you can check either or both.
      </p>


      <h2 class="section-title">Trimming</h2>

      <p>
        On the <b>Source Display</b> you can set the in- and out-points of the analysis by selecting either
        edge of the yellow area on the <b>Timeline</b> and dragging it to the desired timepoint. This will
        affect the real-time playback as well as the analysis videos and images - you can get an idea by
        observing the number of <b>Processed frames</b>.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/04_trimming.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/04_trimming.gif"
        />
      </figure>


      <h2 class="section-title">Skipping</h2>

      <p>
        In order to save time, skipping every other frame, or more, in the analysis 
        can give you a faster analysis while still getting an idea of the motion. 
        You can for example set this to 2, to skip two frames before including 
        a frame in the analysis, then skipping two again. If skipping is set to 1, then
        the analysis will skip every other frame. You can get an idea about how it works 
        by observing the number of <b>Processed frames</b>. Skipping frames can be a huge
        timesaver when working with extremely long videos.
      </p>

      <img src="img/05_skipping.png"/>

      <h2 class="section-title">Cropping</h2>

      <p>
        To crop the source video here is what you should do:
        <ol>
          <li>In the <b>Cropping</b> panel activate cropping with the toggle.</li>
          <li>In the <b>Source Display</b> draw a rectangle over the area you wish to keep.</li>
          <li>Optionally you can also finetune the position of this cropping rectangle with the number boxes.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/03_cropping.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/03_cropping.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Display window</h2>

      <img src="img/DisplayWindow.png"/>

      <p>
        The real-time preview of the analysis can be observed in the <b>Display</b> window. It consists of
        the bounding box video, the history video and the motion video, respectively. You can toggle
        these independently from the <i>Display</i> menu, with the additional option to set the window
        into floating mode. The <b>Display</b> always resizes automatically when you are changing the cropping
        dimension. To adjust the scale of the <b>Display</b> window use dial in the lower-right corner of the interface.
      </p>

      <img src="img/DisplayScale.png"/>

      <h2 class="section-title">Export options</h2>

      <img src="img/ExportOptions.png"/>

      <p>
        When you are satisfied with the current settings it is time to decide what kind of images and videos to render.
        You can toggle these in the <i>Export options</i> menu. Additionally you can also select which filetype you want
        to use for your images.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Export</h2>

      <p>
        To perform the analysis, render all your images, videos, as well as a statistical analysis of motion and a log 
        file, just press the button which says 'Click to export data'. All files will be placed in the same folder as 
        your source video.
      </p>

      <img src="img/ExportButton.png"/>

      <h2 class="section-title">Settings</h2>

      <img src="img/Settings.png"/>

      <p>
        When working with folders, by default VideoAnalysis keeps all settings local to each video. You can change
        this behavior by selecting <i>Settings > Use same settings for each file</i>. In this case the last settings
        (ie. the ones you had at the moment of changing to this mode) will apply to each video file during the batch 
        export. To go back to using independent settings, select <i>Remember settings for each file</i>. It is also 
        possible to save or load all settings into a .json file. This can make it easy to pick up your work where
        you left it, or to share your settings with other users.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Report a problem</h2>

      <img src="img/report.png"/>

      <p>
