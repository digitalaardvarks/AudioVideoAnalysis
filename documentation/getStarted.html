      <h1 id="title">Get Started with AudioVideoAnalysis!</h1>

      <h2 class="section-title">Record</h2>
      <p>
        AudioVideoAnalysis is designed for realtime spectral analysis of 
        video and audio. by clicking <strong>record</strong>, said images 
        are printed onto the applications <strong>display window</strong>. 
        Alternatively, hit the <code>spacebar</code> to toggle recording on
        and off.
      </p>

          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/1-record.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <h2 class="section-title">Device parameters</h2>
      <p>
        Before recording, make sure you have selected your desired 
        device parameters. These include <code>camera device</code>, 
        <code>camera format (resolution) and general audio settings
        </code> such as audio device, samplerate, buffersize, etc. 
        The <code>refreshDevices</code> feature in the video section 
        lets you refresh the video device list if you connect new video 
        hardware to your computer while the application is running.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Audio parameters</h2>
      <p>
        AudioVideoAnalysis features three distinct sections of audio 
        parameters that affect the spectrogram printed in the Display 
        window. These are <code>audio channels</code>, <code>color
        </code> and <code>processing</code>.
      </p>

      <img src="img/3-audio-parameters.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        The <strong>logarithmic</strong> dial controls how logarithmic 
        we want our spectrogram frequency distribution to be. A <em>higher</em> 
        logarithmic value will create a steeper logarithmic curve along the 
        Y-axis of the spectrogram.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/4-logfreq.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/4-logfreq.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        the <strong>spectral blur</strong> effect is, in principle, a vector-sized
        delay and can be used to create more generalized images of the audio 
        amplitude and frequency content. The spectral blur has 3 modes: <code>no 
        blur</code> - <code>blur</code> - <code>lots of blur</code>.
      </p>

      <img src="img/5-spectral-blur.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        AudioVideoAnalysis also features <strong>clickpoint data retrieval
        </strong> of any recorded audio material. This means you can simply 
        point and click anywhere in the display window and get the Amplitude of a 
        certain Frequency(Hz) at a given Time(sec).
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/6-clickpoint.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/6-clickpoint.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: You can use the clickpoint feature, as well as 
        manipulate the spectrograms color and logarithmic frequency distribution, 
        post-recording.
      </p>


      <h2 class="section-title">Video parameters</h2>
      <p>
        AudioVideoAnalysis also features three distinct sections of video parameters
        that affect the motion/videogram printed in the Display window. These are
        <code>image selector</code>, <code>color</code> and <code>filter</code>. 
        There is also a preview window that lets you see how the video-feed is 
        processed <strong>before</strong> it&#39;s printed on the main display 
        window.
      </p>

      <img src="img/7-video-parameters.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        The <strong>Image selector</strong> lets you either view a videogram or motiongram
         in the display window. Both images express vertical motion over time, the only 
         difference is that a motiongram has some additional pre-processing which further 
         isolates motion and reduces image noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        When recording a motiongram, we can use a <strong>binary</strong> or
        &quot;<strong>regular</strong>&quot;(unary) noise reduction filter to 
        reduce unwanted noise in our video-feed. The differences between these two 
        filters are subtle, but a general tendency is that the <strong>binary</strong> filter
        is usually more &quot;radical&quot; than its <strong>regular</strong> counterpart. 
        The preview window can help us see these effects more clearly.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/8-mg-filters.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/8-mg-filters.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: you can also manipulate the motion/videogram color post-recording.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Display parameters</h2>

      <p>
        The application also features several display parameters that enable 
        you to pre-configure and view your spectral recordings in various ways.
        The <strong>Display</strong> section features a <code>RefreshWindow</code> 
        button that clears all content from the display window, as well as a
        <code>rate</code> and <code>grid size</code> function.
      </p>

      <img src="img/9-display-parameters.jpg" width="787" height="304"/>

      <p>
        <strong>Rate</strong> controls how long it takes the spectral recordings to 
        reach the end of the display window, or from x-min to x-max, effectively 
        controlling the printing rate of the recording. Thus, a <em>higher</em> 
        rate value will result in a <em>shorter</em> display length. This <code>Total 
        Display Time</code> is dynamically expressed in seconds in the Display section 
        of the UI. 
      </p>

      <img src="img/10-rate.jpg" width="787" height="615"/>

      <p>
        There are also more display options in the <strong>Menubar</strong>.
      </p>

      <img src="img/11-menubar-display-options.jpg" width="378" height="204"/>

      <p>
        The <code>Bring Display to Front</code> option will glue your display window to the
        front of the screen. Underneath, you will find 4 different 
        <strong>viewing options</strong>. These toggle different ways to view your 
        spectral recording in the display window. 
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/12-view-options.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/12-view-options.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Lastly, you can add <strong>analysis markers</strong> by toggling the 
        <code>View Display Markers</code> and <code>View Display Grid</code> options. 
        Furthermore, by configuring the <code>grid Size</code> in the app UI, 
        you can change the size of your analysis grid. Beware that a grid size of 6 
        corresponds to a visible 4x4 grid. This is because it requires 6 vertical and 
        horizontal lines to generate a 4x4 grid.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/13-analysis-markers.png"
        
          alt="Static Image"
          data-alt="img/13-analysis-markers.gif"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: You can resize the display window by simply clicking and 
        dragging. Furthermore, you can change viewing options and add/remove analysis markers
        post-recording.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Export options</h2>
      <p>
        An important feature of AudioVideoAnalysis is the ability to export
        the images we create. Here, the applications post-recording processing abilities
        come in handy! By using these features we can find good images
        to export for further analysis.
      </p>
